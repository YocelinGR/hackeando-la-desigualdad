## Getting started

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository.
git clone https://github.com/chrisvfritz/vue-enterprise-boilerplate.git my-new-project

# 2. Enter your newly-cloned folder.
cd my-new-project

# 3. Install dependencies. Make sure yarn is installed: https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install
yarn

# 4. Replace this README's CI badge with a note about when you started
# and a link to a compare URL, so that you can always get an overview
# of new features added to the boilerplate since you cloned.
node _start.js

# 5. Delete the start script, as there can be only one beginning.
rm _start.js
